### Instructions

Create an address book application using whatever model you like (database, classes, other). This can be implemented with a text based/command line interface or a graphical user interface/web front end. 

It should:  
* Perform basic CRUD functions - Create, Read, Update, and Delete

### Tips

* You **are not** expected to finish this problem. We are more interested in observing your work process.
* You **are** expected to have code that compiles and that can perform a meaningful function.  
* Feel free to talk out loud through your thought process.
* Focus on funcitonality first and foremost, elegance/user interface only secondarily.
* Choose a language/IDE that you are comfortable with. With the limited time, we would like to see more development, less setup/overhead.

### When complete we will discuss next steps
